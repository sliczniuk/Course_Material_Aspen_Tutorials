\chapter*{Preface}

The research in Plant Design focuses on process feasibility study, synthesis, design, operation, integration, simulation and optimization, as well as  inherent safety, occupational health, pollution prevention and industrial risk. The key theme is the development of systematic methodologies to identify optimum, sustainable and creative strategies that lead to process intensification, yield improvement, debottlenecking, costing, safety, pollution prevention and energy conservation. Fundamental chemical engineering principles are coupled with systems engineering approaches to develop methods and computer-aided tools that are applicable in all areas of chemical process industry. Any plant design work includes preliminary process design, process synthesis, cost engineering, process simulation and environmental and safety aspects of design. This knowledge can be used for the development of new processes, engineering of new plants and improvement of existing ones in the chemical, petrochemical, biofuel, pulp and paper, minerals, food and biotech and pharmaceutical industries.

These lecture notes is a collection of simulations used by Plant Design group while teaching master students.
