# Course Material Aspen Tutorials

The research in Plant Design focuses on a process feasibility study, synthesis, design, operation, integration, simulation and optimization, inherent safety, occupational health, pollution prevention, and industrial risk. The key theme is the development of systematic methodologies to identify optimum, sustainable and creative strategies that lead to process intensification, yield improvement, debottlenecking, costing, safety, pollution prevention and energy conservation. Fundamental chemical engineering principles are coupled with systems engineering approaches to develop methods and computer-aided tools applicable in all chemical process industry areas. Any plant design work includes preliminary process design, process synthesis, cost engineering, process simulation and environmental and safety aspects of design. This knowledge can be used for developing new processes, engineering new plants, and improving existing ones in the chemical, petrochemical, biofuel, pulp and paper, minerals, food and biotech, and pharmaceutical industries.

These lecture notes are a collection of simulations that I use to teach graduate students how to design chemical plants using Aspen Plus.
